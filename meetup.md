# MeetUp.com

## About

Currently we use meetup.com to track RSVPs to a meetup

## An issue with meetup.com

Meetup.com has been testing a change to their RSVP structure.

"Beginning in October, members of select groups will be charged a small fee to reserve their spot at events. The event fee can be paid by members or organizers can cover the cost of events to make it free for members."

"“The payment change is a small test with a few groups. Currently organizers pay to manage their groups and we’re exploring ways to reduce this cost. There will not be significant payment changes in the near term and we’ll provide notice about any future changes.”"

This would be a $2 fee per RSVP on meetup.com

Organizers have the option to subsidize the $2 fee for members who RSVP

The new pricing does not apply to non-profit groups or Pro Networks.

## What We Have to Concider

### Fees

As a local tech group we have a commitment to offering our gathers as free. There would be charges to attendees or organizers can cover this. Currently there are already fees organozers pay to meetup.com. This is fixed bi anual. With this new structure the fee amount is not fixed, instead is porportial to the attendence size of each indivual meetup. 

Some meetups are sponsored otherws are not. 

Havinfg an unpredictable fee structure makes gaining sponsorship tougher. At least for the meetup fees. This could also be a large charge for a particular meetup shuld it turn out to be a popular local topic.

### Community

With many groups using the same platform to organize events has the advantage of visability across groups under a single domain. The community shares a cohesion in this. Our memebers can easly find a more spcialized meetup beyond general web development. This might be language specific or even a non tech meetup. 

For any meetup that does have a $2 fee for RSVP community memebers might be less eager to go depending on how many other meetups they have attended or wanting to attend than month.

### Migration to Options Other than Meetup

Many services over an RSVP platform. ONe of the issues with this is fragmatation. Currently it is easy for a group like Eugene Web Devs to guide someone to a another local group aligned with their interests. Part of the reason is meetup holds the event palnning for most local groups. Should easch group move a differing platform it will bet tougher to guide potential shared community memebers.
