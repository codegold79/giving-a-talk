# giving-a-talk

💥 🎉  First off, thanks for wanting to do a talk! 🎉 💥

Below is a guide for giving a talk.

## What should I know before I get started?
We talk about anything relating to web development. This can be languages, frameworks, packages, paradigms, services, etc.. It's pretty open.

💡 We are always open to suggestions for topics. Contact channels are always on the website.

## How Can I Contribute?
To begin you can open an issue on the waffle board or just contact us directly via Meetup.com ✉️

Once you have given your talk it would be great to add your slides and or presentation resources to resources to the [archive repo](https://github.com/eugenewebdevs/archive) in this group.

## Friendly Suggestions
* Give your self plenty of time to prepare. Use https://slides.com/
* Shoot for 30 to 45 min
* Make your presentation web based and available online. Use https://slides.com/!!!
* Keep the scope small and relevant to your topic.
* Check the font size you have if you are showing code.
* If you have questions about the venue or just want to test out presentation before just message someone in this Organization
* If you are planning on a live coding demo, be fearless. :godmode:
