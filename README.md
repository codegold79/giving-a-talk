# giving-a-talk

💥 🎉  First off, thanks for wanting to do a talk! 🎉 💥

Below is a guide for giving a talk.

## What should I know before I get started?
We talk about anything relating to web development. This can be languages, frameworks, packages, paradigms, services, etc.. It's pretty open.

💡 We have a board for talk ideas over at waffle.io You can look there for suggestions or ad any you come up with. Just login with GitHub and add an issue with the label "talk idea". https://waffle.io/eugenewebdevs/giving-a-talk

## How Can I Contribute?
To begin you can open an issue on the waffle board or just contact us directly via Meetup.com ✉️

Once you have given your talk it would be great to add your slides and or presentation resources to resources to the [archive repo](https://github.com/eugenewebdevs/archive) in this group.

## Friendly Suggestions
* Give your self plenty of time to prepare.
* Keep the scope small and relevant to your topic.
* Check the font size you have if you are showing code.
* If you have questions about the venue or just want to test out presentation before just message someone in this Organization
* If you are planning on live coding, be fearless. :godmode:
